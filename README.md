# How do I set up two-step verification on Telegram?

The two-step verification allows you to better protect your Telegram account from unauthorized access.

Usually, when logging in on a new device, you need to enter a code sent to you via SMS or a Telegram message to another device where you’ve previously logged in. With the two-step verification enabled, you'll also have a password for your account that you'll need to use when you log in.

To enable the two-step verification in your Telegram app, follow these steps:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
1. Open the app and click the three-line menu icon in the top-left corner of the app.
2. Go to **Settings** —> **Privacy and Security.**
3. In the Security menu, click **Two-Step Verification.**
4. Click **Set Password** and choose your password.
5. Reenter your new password.
6. Set an optional password hint to help you remember your password.
7. As an optional step, you can enter your email address for password recovery.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Warning**: If you forget your password, you'll lose access to your Telegram account. That is why it is recommended to use your email for password recovery.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS/Android" %}
1. Open the app and tap the three-line menu icon in the top-left corner of the app.
2. Go to **Settings** —> **Privacy and Security.**
3. In the Security menu, tap **Two-Step Verification.**
4. Tap **Set Password** and choose your password.
5. Reenter your new password.
6. Set an optional password hint to help you remember your password.
7. As an optional step, you can enter your email address for password recovery.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Warning**: If you forget your password, you'll lose access to your Telegram account. That is why it is recommended to use your email for password recovery.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Now you have the two-step verification enabled. The next time you log in to your Telegram account, you will need to type in your password, so make sure your remember it.
